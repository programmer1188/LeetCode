#Intro:
An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, books—anything really.
In Array the items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, 
checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.

# Arrays can hold up to N items. programmer have to decide the Value of N and also the data type of item that will be going into the Array.

# The two most primitive Array operations are writing elements into them, and reading elements from them. 
  All other Array operations are built on top of these two primitive operations.
  
# Each of the places is identified using a number in the range of 0 to N - 1. 
  The 1st place is 0, the 2nd place is 1, the 3rd place is 2... 
  We call these numbers that identify each place indexes.
  
# Java always initializes empty Array slots to null if the Array contains objects, or to default values if it contains primitive types. 
  For example, the array int [] would contain the default value of 0 for each element, 
  float[] would contain default values of 0.0, and bool[] would contain default values of false.
 
# Array Capacity VS Length
  Capacity: The number of DVDs the box could hold, if it was full.
  Length: The number of DVDs currently in the box.
  
# DVD[] array = new DVD[6]  arrray with capacity to store 6 DVD's
  Remembering that indexing starts at 0, we can only insert items at array[0], array[1], array[2], array[3], array[4], and array[5]. 
  Trying to put an element anywhere else, such as array[-3], array[6], or array[100] will cause your code to crash with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
  
# The Array's capacity must be decided when the Array is created. The capacity cannot be changed later.

# The capacity of an Array in Java can be checked by looking at the value of its length attribute. 
  This is done using the code arr.length, where arr is the name of the Array. 
  
  //DVD[] array = new DVD[6]
  //int capacity = array.length;
  //System.out.println("The Array has a capacity of " + capacity);
  
#Storing DVD's


// A simple definition for a DVD.
class DVD {
    public String name;
    public int releaseYear;
    public String director;

    public DVD(String name, int releaseYear, String director) {
        this.name = name;
        this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
        this.director = director;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", directed by " + this.director + ", released in " + this.releaseYear;
    }
}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        // The actual code for creating an Array to hold DVD's.
        DVD[] dvdCollection = new DVD[15];    
        
        // Firstly, we need to actually create a DVD object for The Avengers.
        DVD avengersDVD = new DVD("The Avengers", 2012, "Joss Whedon");
        
        DVD incrediblesDVD = new DVD("The Incredibles", 2004, "Brad Bird");
        DVD findingDoryDVD = new DVD("Finding Dory", 2016, "Andrew Stanton");
        DVD lionKingDVD = new DVD("The Lion King", 2019, "Jon Favreau");
        
        // Next, we'll put it into the 8th place of the Array. Remember, because we
        // started numbering from 0, the index we want is 7.
        dvdCollection[7] = avengersDVD;
        
        // Put "The Incredibles" into the 4th place: index 3.
        dvdCollection[3] = incrediblesDVD;
        
        // Put "Finding Dory" into the 10th place: index 9.
        dvdCollection[9] = findingDoryDVD;
        
        // Put "The Lion King" into the 3rd place: index 2.
        dvdCollection[2] = lionKingDVD;
        
        // Print out what's in indexes 7, 10, 3 and 2.
        System.out.println(dvdCollection[7]);
        System.out.println(dvdCollection[9]);
        System.out.println(dvdCollection[3]);
        System.out.println(dvdCollection[2]);
        
        //Overwrite [3]
        DVD starWarsDVD = new DVD("Star Wars", 1977, "George Lucas");
        dvdCollection[3] = starWarsDVD;
        
        //Java always initializes empty Array slots to null
        System.out.println(dvdCollection[1]);
        
        
    }
}

#Using For loop to write Items in an Array:

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        int[] squaresNumbers = new int[10];
        
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
            int square = i*i;
            squaresNumbers[i-1] = square;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
            System.out.println("Square of "+ (i+1) +" is "+ squaresNumbers[i]);
        }
          
         //A more elegant way of printing out the values of an Array—a variant of the for loop, 
        //commonly referred to as a "for each" loop.
        
        // We can use it whenever we don't need the index values.
        
        for(int square : squaresNumbers){
            System.out.println(square);
        }
    }
}



# Basic Array operations
# In this section, we'll be looking at the three basic operations that are supported by almost every data structure; insertion, deletion, and search.

Inserting a new element into an Array can take many forms:
1. Inserting a new element at the end of the Array.
2. Inserting a new element at the beginning of the Array.
3. Inserting a new element at any given index inside the Array.

# Insertion at the end of the array is simple O(1) operation

# Insertion at the start of the array is very costly operation, since each of the existing elements has to be shifted one step to the right. 
  The need to shift everything implies that this is not a constant time operation. 
  In fact, the time taken for insertion at the beginning of an Array will be proportional to the length of the Array.
  In terms of time complexity analysis, this is a linear time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the Array.

# Similarly, for inserting at any given index, we first need to shift all the elements from that index onwards one position to the right.

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] array = new int[6];
		
	    int length = 0;
	    
	    for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
	        array[length] = i;
	        length++;
	    }
		
		for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++){
		    System.out.println("Index "+ i +" contains "+ array[i]);
		}
		
		System.out.println("Insertion at end of array");
		//Insert at end of array
		array[length] = 10;
		length++;
		
		for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++){
		    System.out.println("Index "+ i +" contains "+ array[i]);
		}
		
		// Inserting at the Start of an Array To insert an element at the start of an Array, 
        //we'll need to shift all other elements in the Array to the right by one index to create space for the new element.
        for(int i=3;i>=0;i--){
            array[i+1] = array[i];
        }
        
        array[0] = 20;
        System.out.println("Insertion at start of array");
        
        for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++){
		    System.out.println("Index "+ i +" contains "+ array[i]);
		}
		
		//Insertion at middle of array
		//Insert at position 2
		System.out.println("Insertion at middle of array");
        
        
		for(int i=4;i>=2;i--){
		    array[i+1] = array[i];
		}
		
		array[2] = 5;
		
		for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++){
		    System.out.println("Index "+ i +" contains "+ array[i]);
		}
        
	}
}

# Array Deletion
Deletion in an Array works in a very similar manner to insertion, and has the same three different cases:

1. Deleting the last element of the Array.
2. Deleting the first element of the Array.
3. Deletion at any given index.


public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int[] a = new int[10];
		
		int length = 0;
		
		for(int i=0;i<6;i++){
		    a[length] = i;
		    length++;
		}
		
		//array capacity
		
		for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Index " + i + " contains " + a[i]);
        }
        
        System.out.println();
        
        //array length is calculated based on length variable 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Index " + i + " contains " + a[i]);
        }
        
        //to delete last element of the array just reduce length
        length--;
        
        System.out.println();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Index " + i + " contains " + a[i]);
        }
        
        // Deleting From the Start of an Array
        // If we want to delete the first element of the Array, that will create a vacant spot at the 0th index. 
        // To fill that spot, we will shift the element at index 1 one step to the left.
        
        // Starting at index 1, we shift each element one position to the left.
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++) {
            // Shift each element one position to the left
            a[i - 1] = a[i];
        }
        
        length--;
        
        System.out.println();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Index " + i + " contains " + a[i]);
        }
        
        // Say we want to delete the element at index 1
        for (int i = 2; i < length; i++) {
            // Shift each element one position to the left
            a[i - 1] = a[i];
        }
        
        // Again, the length needs to be consistent with the current state of the array.
        length--;
        
        System.out.println();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            System.out.println("Index " + i + " contains " + a[i]);
        }
        
	}
}
